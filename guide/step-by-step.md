### Set up
- [x] Ensure everyone has a GitHub account 
- [x] Collect GitHub username
	- [ ] user_one
	- [ ] user_two
	- [ ] user_three
	- [ ] user_four
	- [ ] user_five
	- [ ] user_six
- [x] Guide them to make their own fork of the repository
- [x] Ensure they have issues enabled "Settings/General/Enable issues"
- [x] Make to directories "my_code" and "partner_code"
- [x] Clone their repository inside "my_code"
- [x] Note: SSH key might be needed
- [ ] Install poetry (not really needed)

### Basic commands
- [x] Start by making a simple commit to edit a README file
- [x] Make a new issue and a branch from that issue
- [x] Make multiple commits editing the README file 
- [x] Explain the differences between the three ways to "merge" changes to "main"
- [x] Ask them to repeat the process two more times, each choosing a different merging way
- [x] Ask them to explore the history of the main branch. Explain the importance of a clear and clean git history and when each of these "merging" ways comes in handy.

### Collaboration in Git
- [x] Assign partners, or circular assignments based on usernames
- [x] Ensure the forks are public
- [x] Ask them to go to the repository of their assigned partner. Make an issue about the README file and start developing it for someone else. IMPORTANT: Ask them to clone their partner repository in a different directory from their own repository ("partner_code")
- [x] Make a pull request into the repository of their partner
- [x] Go to check the pull request that the partner made on their repo and ask for corrections.
- [x] Apply the corrections to their partner repository and complete the pull request

### Discussion on different Workflows
### Best workflow for the time

### Merging vs Rebasing
- [ ] Use VS Code (if possible) and install GitLens
- [ ] NOTE: Depending on time and previous exercise this will be done by working in pairs.
- [ ] Make two issues, and create branches for each of them. (new quote vs random quotes)
- [ ] Complete the pull request for one of them.
- [ ] Attempt to merge the second one and fail
- [ ] Resolve the conflict by merging. Can edit on GitHub
- [ ] Make another two issues (formatted printing vs logger)
- [ ] Complete the pull request for one of them.
- [ ] Attempt to merge the second one and fail
- [ ] Resolve by rebasing the feature branch locally.
- [ ] Compare the history of both processes and explain their differences.

### CI pipeline
- [ ] Guide the creation of the file ci.yml step by step

### CD pipeline
- [ ] Guide the creation of the file cd.yml step by step
